? Optimize PF2 text printing? It seems a bit slow (in algorithm).
? Built-in PostScript (Even if very basic)
? Data compression for GB03. Optional
? Plugin, for including community features (that involves usefulness but also bloatness)
  It's usually messy. Try forking in your own way, at the moment.
? Process picture with WebAssembly? (Web frontend only)
? Put Android APP on F-Droid? But it needs automatic build system...
  Android guys can help this!
? ... Or put to APKPure? But make frontend well before doing all of these
