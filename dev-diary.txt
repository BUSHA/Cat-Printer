31st

Well, frontend development is just ongoing.

APRIL

1st

Costed one hour try to find an event propagation problem,
but finally found it's a matter of CSS selector.

BTW frontend can communicate with backend now.

2nd

(Formally) Started playing with Android.

Costed 4 hours to find why Java class (on android) always can't be found,
but finally realized pyjnius can't work with python thread/subprocess,
while I'm using ThreadingHTTPServer.

See "Note" around:
    https://python-for-android.readthedocs.io/en/latest/buildoptions/#webview

NEVER MISS ANY SENTENCE OF A DOCUMENT

3rd

Costed the whole day to solve WebView problem --
    it doesn't do reaction to <input type="file"> by default.

Finally done with library AdvancedWebView, but still with some hacks.

... It's now 4th 2:00 a.m. though

4th

Purged many small problems.

Wished to release it today, but no luck...

5th

Bundle script, optimized project structure.

It's finally ready...

6th

Documentation.

What else? First Release!
