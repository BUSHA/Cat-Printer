# I18N

*Internationalization*, or *i18n*, is concerned in this project.

Currently User Interface related files are stored in `www/lang`  
As well as `readme.i18n` and `i18n.i18n` for readme.
In the future, there can be other manual files.

## What to do

In simple cases, you just make a copy of already-there language file, and modify it to your local language.  
You should know what's your locale "code", for example "English (US)" is `en-US`. You can look at your browser locale configuration, or gather on the Web.
After that, add an entry in `list.json`.

## It seems can't satisfy another grammar

That's what is going to be fun:

This i18n implementation didn't do built-in basics.  
Instead the grammar details is all done by code.

That doesn't mean difficulty:

- You can simply describe how should the grammar work, by communicating with natual language, with someone that could write code, at here or around you.
- At here almost everyone could do programming. Coding grammar needs much less work -- it's what a junior programmer could do to improve his/her skill.
- Don't forget me! There are Issue and Discussion.

- Oh you actually can do code? Look at file `www/i18n-ext.js` then you could get the point. Also see `www/i18n.d.ts` for typing details. You may modify both.
